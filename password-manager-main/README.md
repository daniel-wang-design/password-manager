# PM by CDTeach

Password Manager created by Cindy Li and Daniel Wang


PM was inspired by the various password managers out there, such as Google autofill passwords. Howevver, we created the app to bring ease of access to accessing and managing all your passwords, something we did not see was currently available. 


Our app allows users to only remember 1 set of login details in order to access all of their other login info on their phone. PM allows users to store, organize, and create new login details for the various social media, digital services, banks, and other accounts that a user may have. 


PM was built on the arcade framework, a set of python modules used to create 2-dimensional applications, especially games. 


As arcade is quite a small scale framework, it contained many bugs which made testing difficult at times. For example, the same code would result in different interactivity between our members. 


Some of the accomplishments that we are proud of include being able to create an interactive app with limited time and resources. Our video was also nicely made and adds a nice touch to our project. We are also proud that we were able to adapt and use a game coding framework to create an app that was not intended to be created using arcade. 


We learned how applications commonly rendered the screen, how to create different user interfaces, login screens, etc. We also learned how to prioritize and create an app given the limited time and resources. 


We would like to add increased security measures such as two-factor authentication, or having a facial or fingerprint scan. We would also like to refine the user interface given more time.
